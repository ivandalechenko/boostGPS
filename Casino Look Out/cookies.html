              <p class="ofwpixddmefdoz">
                When you visit our Website, your browser automatically saves a small information file called a cookie on your computer's hard disk or mobile device. These cookies uniquely identify your device, not you personally, by retaining essential data that helps us recognize if you have been to our site before. Only the server that set the cookie can access it, ensuring they can't spread viruses or access your private information. Our cookies serve specific purposes detailed in this section and do not have any other uses. For delivering our Services, we utilize both first-party session and persistent cookies, as well as third-party persistent cookies. Session cookies vanish once you close your browser, while persistent cookies remain until they naturally expire or you decide to remove them from your browser.

              <p style="font-weight: bold" class="posvbfw">2. What are the types of cookies we use?</p>

              <p class="adkdr">
                Our website employs first-party session cookies that capture basic connection details of your computer to the Internet, known as "session data". These cookies are temporary, disappearing when you close your browser. Their purpose is to streamline your experience by remembering your preferences and sparing you from re-entering information. Importantly, personal details like your name and address aren't collected or stored in these cookies, ensuring your data isn't shared with third parties unless explicitly stated.

                We also use cookies to track how visitors reach our site, aiding in compensating our affiliates. In some cases, third-party cookies are used, sourced from trusted entities to protect your privacy. A notable example is our use of Google Analytics' persistent cookies, which gather data on user interactions like clicks, time spent on the site, page visits, browser types, and visit frequencies. This information, sent to Google Analytics, is key in enhancing our website and refining our services. However, the unique identification provided by Google Analytics is exclusive to Google. For more information, visit Google Analytics' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

                You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing your return visits by disabling cookies in your browser. These Google Analytics cookies may remain for up to two years. Additionally, we use Live Chat cookies, another form of third-party persistent cookies, gathering information like your name, IP address, and browser details during live chat sessions for better assistance. For more on this, visit Live Chat's Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.

                Furthermore, our site may feature social media buttons/plugins enabling connectivity with your social networks. These networks, like Facebook or Twitter, may set cookies through our site for their data collection, aligned with their respective privacy policies.

              <p class="xhbhltol">
                Most internet browsers are set to accept cookies by default, but you have the option to modify your browser settings or use specific software to manage your cookie preferences. You can either disable cookies entirely or configure your browser to notify you when cookies are sent. While our Website respects your decision to block unwanted online activities, including those from untrustworthy sites, please note that blocking our cookies might affect the functionality of certain features on our Website. However, it's possible to allow cookies from trusted sites while blocking others. For managing and deleting cookies as per your preference, you can find helpful information at AllAboutCookies.org.
